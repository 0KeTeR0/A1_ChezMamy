    "faq_q1"=>"Can intergenerational, supportive cohabitation be achieved at any age?",
    "faq_a1"=>"The concept of intergenerational and supportive cohabitation is framed by the Loi Elan and stipulates that young people under 30 and people over 60, can do intergenerational cohabitation.<br><br>If you're over 30 and under 60, we invite you to visit 'La Carte des Colocs' or 'Cooloc'. They offer shared accommodation, rooms in private homes and room-sharing for all ages.",
    "faq_q2"=>"Can I register throughout the year?",
    "faq_a2"=>"Yes, of course. All you have to do is register your profile on our site - simply, free of charge and in just a few clicks. You can also create your profile now with a later availability or search date.",
    "faq_q3"=>"What does intergenerational cohabitation look like?",
    "faq_a3"=>"We draw up an intergenerational cohabitation contract, which is not a lease contract, but a charter for living well together, setting out all the organizational, relational and financial conditions established between each party. This contract entitles you to APL benefits as a student/young worker, and to tax exemption on the amounts received for the accommodation if you are over 60.",
    "faq_q4"=>"Can I host a young person if I'm a tenant?",
    "faq_a4"=>"Yes, we'll provide you with a letter to give to your landlord informing him or her that you're living with a young person, but your landlord can't object (unlike a sublet or shared flat).<br><br> Whether you are a tenant in a private, public or social housing scheme, the concept of intergenerational cohabitation is available to you.<br><br> Cf article L. 631-17 of the 2018 law on the evolution of housing, development and digital.",
